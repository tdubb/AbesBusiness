            <h1>What We Do</h1>
            <p>- Traditional systems focus on neutralizing waste; the ABES next generation system is designed for energy creation.</p>
            <p>Conventional single stage AD digesters implement established technology and have a large installed base, particularly at wastewater treatment facilities. Until recently, the primary design goals of conventional AD systems at waste water treatment facilities have been organic waste volume reduction and biological stabilizationâ€”not renewable energy production. Single stage digesters do not provide sufficient energy yields and potential investment return to make AD a meaningful participant in the future repertoire of renewable energy technology.
            <p>The ABES system can be described as a threestage, multiphase system. The system mimics the advanced and highly efficient multistage digestive systems found in more advanced animals, including insects. Note that Stage I can be a retrofitted conventional digester in a municipal waste water setting. Stages II and III are bolted on to enable the separation of microbial populations necessary to achieve the improved energy outputs contemplated in the ABES design approach.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>- Creates 6 to 8 times the gross revenue through energy creation while costing no more.</p>
            <p>The ABES design approach emphasizes, among other things, the establishment of synergistic production, a characteristic of complex biological systems in which the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Examples of the additive effects of synergy are to be found in all living things, including complex microbial ecosystems. By integrating the engineering and basic biochemical features of conventional AD system designs with advanced biological systems concepts, the ABES design will dramatically improve process operation and performance through establishment of a stable, synergistic and more highly productive ecosystem. The effect of this synergy is a gross revenue increase of up to 8 times while keeping costs in line with traditional AD systems.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>- Is engineered and ready to be deployed.</p>
            <p>The ABES system has not only been designed from an engineering perspective but also from a systems biology perspective thereby taking every detail into account. Here are some of the details as addressed by the respective disciplines.</p>
            <p><b>ENGINEERING:</b></p>
            <p>Tank Design, Hydraulic Design, Mechanical Process Design, Gas Transfer, Pumps/Piping/Appurtenances, Process Control Systems, Life Cycle Analysis, Process Safety, Construction Management, Operational Flexibility, Mathematical Modeling, Operational Validation</p>
            <p><b>BIOLOGY:</b></p>
            <p>Microbial Process Biochemistry, Microbial Ecosystem Design, Food Chain Structure, Biological Energy Flow, Feedstock Adaptability, Synergistic Effects, Product Inhibition, Competition Effects, Biological Stability, Biofilm Development, Start-Up, Energy Output Optimization</p>
            <p>Looking at the ABES system from every angle and employing only proven technology assures that it'll be up and running efficiently right from the start.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>- Breaks down cellulosic material, reducing solids by at least 80%.</p>
            <p>Stage I operates at an acidic pH thereby suppresing methane production until Stage III which promotes more effective hydrolysis. Increased Hydroloysis rates allow for higher rates of feedstock throughput and higher rates of soluble and gaseous food production for the methanogens in Stage III.(Note that higher mixing rates in single stage digesters tend to reduce methane production due to shear forces.) This increase in hydrolysis allows for the increase breakdown of cellulosic material and reduction of solids by at least 80%.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>- Makes cogeneration smooth and flexible, easily moving from digesting one product to another without straining the system.</p>
            <p>The methane suppression in Stage I greatly reduces the concern for cessation of energy production caused by the presence of toxins in the feedstock, ensuring greater reliability of energy production. This reduction in toxins also allows for the addition of mixed feedstocks (e.g., the addition of fats, food wastes and manures) become realistic options for operators to further increase gas production. The addition of fats and oils alone has been shown to almost double methane production. In the ABES system, an operator does not need to carefully balance the requirements of the methanogen populations when considering alternative feedstocks (as must be done in single stage systems).</p>
            <hr>
            <p>- Can be installed completely new or as an upgrade to an existing system.</p>
            <p>The Stage I reactor in the ABES system is a tank of equivalent size to a conventional single stage digestor and ABES is able to easily upgrade a current AD system by utlizing the conventional single stage digestor already in place. The Stage II and Stage III digestors are both only 1/10 of the size of the Stage I tank and can be quickly tied into at an existing site or all three tanks can be installed to create a brand new ABES three stage AD system.</p>
